i had recently graduated with a associates degree in business administration and i was working for a group of business executives who manage vendors and retailers. i would help them with entering data and gathering records for their business ventures. i also, collected data from clients for the advertisers.

anyways, most of the business executives on staff were very nice and friendly, except this one elderly female business executive. she was so rude she always harassed me and she was so moody and had an attitude. anyways there was this one night she gave me a task of organizing the folders in her office. she screamed at me because i could not figure out a certain detail. she was very rude and hostile and she made me question the whole field of business. needless to say, she left a very negative impression on me about how even individuals in business can be rude, conceited, and unprofessional.

because my boss was so rude to me, i decided to quit my job without giving the standard and professional two week notice. i know it was unethical because there are clients and coworkers at the store who rely on the data entry that i engage in so that they can continue to receive services. but i personally felt that i was being treated poorly by my boss, so the day i quit, i pretended like i was going to step out for lunch and instead i never returned back, called the office, or let anyone know that i was quitting. although, this can be seen as unethical to quit without proper notice, i feel that my boss was unethical and rude for treating me rudely and poorly. two wrongs do not make a right, but i had to protect my self-respect.

i believe our ice cream business is thriving because we are lucky to live in a time when computer technology, robots, and the internet are all converging into a singularity that allows for synthetic and automated algorithmic processes to manage 95% of the manufacturing and 20% of the distribution process for dealing with ice cream. also, advances in freezing and storage technology of ice cream has reduced loss and increased profits exponentially. in the past some freezers were unable to maintain consistent temperatures due to moisture, external temperatures, voltage fluctuations, and aging. now new freezing technology makes ice cream storage incredibly efficient at maintaining a high quality product for months.

"3436","R_3OjHghTlqfSZuRU",2073,5,"truth","something i am good at is that i have a great memory. for example i remember
the first time i lived abroad was when i was young and living in india. i was born in america, but my family is from india. we moved back to india for ten years starting when i was five years old. i remember when i was five years old in india, playing inside the walled compound of my grandmotherã¢â‚¬â„¢s home. i was playing with a toy and i heard a knock at the gate door separating our home from the street. i opened the door and a young indian boy who was skinny had a small empty bowl and showed it to me and asked for rice. i immediately closed the door and went about playing. 

my mother came outside and asked me who it was and i said it was a beggar and she got mad at me because i closed the door. after she yelled at me and slapped me, she went inside the house got some food and brought it to the door and gave the food to the young boy outside of the gate. that is the moment in which i understood that there exists poverty and that turning a blind eye to it does not make it go away. i was better off than a stranger in that instance, but it does not make my actions right towards the young boy who was starving.

at a young age, having begun to realize that there exists poverty, hunger, and homelessness i began to become more affectionate towards my family, compassionate towards the poor and downtrodden, and empathetic towards those who are suffering and experience pain. life experiences, even for young people, can be profoundly enlightening, but they also encourage us to give consideration to the environment around us, the world we live in, and to try and empathize with those individuals who we also share our world with. my experience of living in india, was seeing a lot of suffering, but also a lot of generosity and kindness towards those who are less fortunate.
