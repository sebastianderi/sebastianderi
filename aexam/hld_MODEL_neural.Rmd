I will now build a neural network predictive model.

# Packages

Again, I will start by loading relevant packages.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# before knitting: message = FALSE, warning = FALSE
library(tidyverse) # cleaning and visualization
library(ggthemes) # visualization
library(caret) # modeling
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(pROC) # ROC curve
```


# Load Data

Next, I will load the various cleaned versions of the data we just
created.

```{r}
# load all the nice tidy df's of features we created (remember stats_words has multiple dtm's)
load("stats_all.Rda")

```

## Step 1a: Split the Data (Index)

```{r}
# get index for random 50% of data, and count this as training data (rest will be test)
index_neural <- createDataPartition(y = stats_all$grd_truth,
                                 p = 0.50,
                                 list = FALSE)

# check length (should be 2502)
length(index_neural)
```

## Step 1b: Split the Data (Actual Train and Test Set)

```{r}
train_neural <- stats_all[index_neural, ]
test_neural <- stats_all[-index_neural, ]
```


```{r}
# train model

nnetGrid <- expand.grid(.size = 1:10,
                        .decay = c(0, .1, 1, 2))
maxSize <- max(nnetGrid$.size)
numWts <- (maxSize * (length(names(stats_all))) + maxSize + 1)

model_neural <-
  train(x = train_neural[, !(names(train_neural) %in% c("stat_id", "grd_truth"))],
        y = train_neural$grd_truth,
        method = "nnet",
        preProc = c("center", "scale", "spatialSign"),
        # maxit = 2000,
        trace = FALSE,
        # MaxNWts = numWts,
        tuneGrid = nnetGrid)

# get predictions of model
neural_predicts <-
  predict(object = model_neural,
          newdata = test_neural[, !(names(train_neural) %in% c("stat_id", "grd_truth"))])

# confusion matrix, with results
confusionMatrix(neural_predicts, test_neural$grd_truth)
```
