	<h1> format explanation </h1>
	
		<p> this website and some of the content in it might seem bare. that is become sometimes there is a tradeoff between "form" and "function", or "beauty" and "quality". i don't think having a beautiful website serves any function here, so i opted to make the website purely functional. that same style of decision-making also explains why you the format of some of the content linked to in this website might seem unusual. if the "ugliness" of the form bothers you more than the "interestingness" of the content, feel free to not consume any of it, i won't be mad or sad or ashamed or whatever other negative emotion i could have. </p>
		
	<h1> content </h1>
	
		<p> i am a graduate student in a social psychology phd program. you might expect that guarantees that i want to become a professor. that is not the case. to reitirate a similar flavor from above, i believe that there are some perverse incentives in academia, which lead people to produce content that values "form" more than "function", "beauty" more than "quality". thus, i have decided that i only want to pursue a career in this field if i can strike what feels to me like the right balance between form/beauty v. function/quality. some factors that i believe hinder my personal ability to do that include: incentives to publish in "prestigious" journals, incentives to publish as many papers as possible, incentives to publish in only your field, incentives to be a "first author".</p>
		
		<p> currently, i have 2 years of funding left from a fellowship granted to me by an organization outside of "my" university, and one year of funding left from a fellowship granted to me by "my" university. that means, i have three years left to find out whether my attempt to strike the balance that feels right for me, allows me to "advance to the next stage" (i.e. become a professor). if not, i am sure i can find another career path that provides for my basic and idiosyncratic needs. </p>
		
		<p> i presume you are here to find out more about me. either you are interested in my academic work, in which case, here is a link to my <a href="cv.pdf">cv</a>. if you want to actually read any of my papers, you should be able to access them <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-XzVPewAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">here</a>, but if not (e.g. you don't have access to the journal or the journal is not open access), then feel free to email me. or you might be here to find out more about me in a non-academic sense. in that case, feel free to email me or friend and/or message <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sebastian.Deri">me on facebook</a> or friend and/or message me <a href="https://twitter.com/SebastianDeri">on twitter</a>. <p>
