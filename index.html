	<h1>sebastian deri's website</h1>
	
	<p> hi there. sebastian deri is a fairly uncommon name. so i think you found who you're looking for. congrats! and thanks for stopping by. </p>
	
	<h2> basics </h2>
	
	<p> here's my <a href="CV Sebastian Deri 2019 (October) [a].pdf">cv</a> and 
	<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-XzVPewAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">google scholar page </a> </p>.

	<h2> research statement </h2>
	
	<p> 1: i am a fourth year doctoral student in psychology at cornell. currently, i'm interested in deception and the internet's effects on people and
	society. previously, i've done research on political polarization, social comparison, and misperceptions of social influence. i've also interned and done 
	research at facebook and nokia bell labs. i like working on interdisciplinary teams. i jump around, and start more than i finish--a quality i am not proud of. </p>
	
	<p> 2: i am, for now, supported by a 4-year fellowship, called the NDSEG, which comes from money from the department of defense. without a doubt, this award is the
	proudest professional achievement of my life. i am honored that my country would invest literal money in my career and ideas. i feel a sense of
	obligation to make that investment worth their while. </p>
	
	<p> 3: i am deeply troubled by problems that the methodological reform and open science movements have revealed about social psychology specifically, as well as
	science (e.g. social science, biological sciences) more generally. i support efforts to be more open and rigorous and find the burying-of-head-in-sand reactions
	of some to be shameful and detrimental to the reputation and long-term health of our field. we all need to do better. </p>
	
	<h2> ongoing projects </h2>
	
	<p> here's a list of ongoing research projects, presented publically partly to keep myself accountable for finishing them </p>
	
	<li> <a href="internet polarization.pdf"> review paper on: does internet use cause "polarization", and how? </a> </li>
	<li> <a href="aexam/hld_OVERVIEW.html"> how do humans compare to computers at lie detection, and can the skills of both be combined? </a> </li>
	<li> <a href="Big Brazen Lies.pdf"> are we more likely to believe "big" lies? and what is a big lie anyway?</a> </li>
	<li> what happens when you put kids through a turing test?</li>
	<li> in what ways can embracing neurodiversity protect against stigma surrounding mental illness? </li>
	
	<h2> personal things </h2>
	
	<p> i imagine most people coming to this website are doing so for professional or professional-ish reasons. but here is a little part of the internet staked out just for me!, and it feels like a waste to only use it for career-ee stuff. it's a little exhilirating to be able to broadcast "directly" to the world in some sense. <!-- of course we can and do all broadcast messages from facebook, twitter, etc. but those mediums constrain what we say.  exist (and are in effect), but somehow this medium has --> in the flavor of the pre-massively-corporate, pre-heavily-polarized internet--one of blogs, chatrooms, and personal websites--which i caught only the tail end of, but feel like i understand and support in spirit, here are a few not particularly important blog-ee/list-ee type stuff and other errent thoughts i want to from my machine to yours: </p> 
	
	<li> <a href = "https://medium.com/@sebastian.deri/spice-c925fdd7a7c4"> spice </a> </li>
	<li>books</li>
	<li>movies</li>
	<li>music</li>
	<li> <a href = "quotes.pdf">quotes</a></li>
	<li>mountain biking</li>
	
	<h2> final thoughts </h2>
	
	<p>reminder to myself: be kind, assume the best, value diversity and imagination <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0UVCgnUL8&t=41s">.</a> i know that's all a little cheesy, but hey there's worth things than being cheesy and it seems worth concluding on something nice. </p>

		<p> this is "my" website. i last updated it on august 2nd, 2019. if you want to get in contact, feel free to email, direct message on twitter, friend me on facebook, or call. pick your medium by urgency. i guess that's why we don't even ask for physical addresses anymore? the message is the medium? (what what was all that about anyway? never read it. well, haven't read it yet. and maybe never will? but seems interesting) </p>
	
	<h1> about me </h1>
	
		<p> i am a graduate student in a social psychology phd program. you might expect that guarantees that i want to become a professor. that is not the case. for the sake of analogy, imagine there is a tradeoff between "quality" and "beauty", or "function" and "form" (in yet other words). i believe that there exist some incentives in academia, which are perverse. these perverse incentives and other factors can lead people to strike what (at least) i and (some arbitrary set of) others (e.g. let's just say a representative sample of researchers (sampled on at least the demographics of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, "mental illness"/"mental well-being", "intelligence", etc.) to be an "extreme" balance between quality and beauty, or form and function (and you certaintly can be extreme in either direction). because of this belief i have about perverse incentives leading to extreme balances, i have decided that i only want to pursue a career in this field if i can strike what feels to me like the right balance between form, beauty, function, quality, "objective", "subjective", whatever you want to call it. to be a little more specific, some of the factors that at least i would describe as perverse include: incentives to publish in "prestigious" journals, incentives to publish as many papers as possible, incentives to publish in only "my" field, incentives to be a "first author". in a sentence, it's fucked up. and i don't want to be part of a field if i have to make it more fucked up rather than less fucked up. so i won't. </p>

	<h1> puzzles ... i mean ongoing research projects (at varying stages of completion, none published) <h1>
	
		<div>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li> how can we know which of our experiences are "real"? </li>
			<li> how much should we trust our memories? is this what trust is? or is that just imagination? </li>
			<li> what portion of our experience of time is "subjective" and what portion is "objective"? </li>
			<li> what portion of our experience of "pain" is "subjective" and what portion is "objective"? </li>
			<li> does surprise have something to do with pain over time? </li>
			<li> is pain over time what "utility" is? or is it pleasure? but how to measure either? </li>
			<li> is beauty happiness over time? </li>
			<li> are we more "atuned" to beauty or pain? hypothesis: beauty. maybe i'm just an optimist? </li>
			<li> is cognitice dissonance just another name for "painful memory"? does this have something to with trauma? </li>
			<li> is "pain tolerance" related to "the amount of cognitive dissonance" you can with "stand"/"withstand"?</li>
			<li> is the goal of social psychology to make up new words that "enter the popular lexicon"/"become public knowledge"? </li>
			<li> what if there is no such thing as "attention" or "ADD/ADHD"? or what if a better way of thinking about it is just "visual attention" and "auditory attention"? </li>
			<li> what if there is no such thing as "mental illness"? or at least that "mental well-being" and "mental health" are same thing, just over different time scales? </li>
			<li> why does time seem to have so much to do with all of this? </li>
			<li> wouldn't it be cool to have something like Hilbert's problems for psychology? how would that work? why were the problem's Hilbert's? </li>
			<li> do different demographic groups value each other's lives differently? or just time? or what about some unit like life-years? or life-seconds? </li>
			<li> are you more worried that "others" will commit suicide or homicide? or does this depend on which demographic group you are thinking about when i say "others"? </li>
			<li> does racism have something to do with how how "finely" (e.g. binary, finite sets, continuous) you perceive different "demographic groups"? </li>
			<li> why do people think that things "happen in threes"? does it have to with the distinction i just made above: binary, finite sets, continuous? </li>
			<li> rather than all that stuff about ordinal, cardinal, scales, should psychology scales be thought of as in three groups: binary, finite, infinite? </li>
			<li> or maybe there should only be two types of "psychology scales": binary and non-binary (i.e. continuous)</li>
			<li> what would the "end points" be of the binary scale? a proposal: life, death </li>
			<li> or maybe all psychology scales should have "two dimensions"? a life-death dimension, a self-others dimensions. </li>
			<li> ore maybe all psychology scales should have "three dimensions"? a life-death dimension, a self-others dimension, and a "time" dimension? e.g. how bad did that paste taste? and you rate how bad that feels in terms of (life-death)-(self-others)-(time) "units", or you could call them (pain-please)-(self-other)-(time) units </li>
			<li> </li>
			<li> is time binary or continuous? maybe time just "blinks"? maybe computers operate at the "speed of time"? </li>
			<li> wait, does that mean we are computers? haha, sounds a little far-fetched ... maybe? too "early to tell" i guess </li>
			<li> but "machines" (computers, cars, etc.) were always a useful analogy for humans or the human mind? why? </li>
			<li> or maybe the question is -- are humans, slowly "trying" to build machines more and more like themselves over time? </li>
			<li> is Facebook a rorschach test for society? do we see in Facebook what we are? or are trying to make Facebook like we want to become? </li>
			<li> are the kindest people the most rushed or the least busy? </li>
			<li> <a href="Big Brazen Lies.pdf"> what is a "big" lie? </a> </li>
			<li> are the words of prophets written on the subway walls? tenament halls? tenament halls? should i shut up? or is that just the sound of silence? </li>
			<li> do different "drugs" heal "pain" over different time periods? </li>
			<li> <a href="aexam/hld_OVERVIEW.html"> can we "detect" lies from text? </a> </li>
			<li> why did we forget about freud? fraud? wait ... is that a fraudian slip? </li>
			<li> is it better to think of a rorschach as mirror, but one that you don't know which way it's face. "you" or "the psychiatrist"? </li>
			<li> at what age do we "grow up"? i guess literally when out height plateaus. but what about "figuratively"? </li>
			<li> does lack of punctuation indicate a lack of respect for authority? or just being a rush for time? </li>
			<li> <a href="internet polarization.pdf"> review paper on: does internet use cause "polarization", and how? </a> </li>
			<li> what should i do with my life? oh wait ... that one's not a research project. good puzzle though! </li>
			<li> how would you behave if the whole world were watching you? would it make you a better person or a worse person? </li>
			<li> what's the "craziest" thing someone else told you? was it funny or was it scary? </li>
			<li> who's the "craxiest" person you ever met? did they scare you or make you feel better about yourself? </li>
